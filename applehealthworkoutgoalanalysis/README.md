You will first need to export your health data from apple health and then airdrop it to you computer.  
Once there you can use the appleheathdata.py script developed by tdda to parse the data.  
After the data has been parsed you can used this script to set a weekly workout duration and frequency target.  
The script will then analyze the workouts.csv file produced by applehealth.py and calculate how many times you met the objective.
