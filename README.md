Extract Data from Apple Health App's XML Export

Discussed in blog posts at http://tdda.info, including:

  * v1.0: http://www.tdda.info/in-defence-of-xml-exporting-and-analysing-apple-health-data

  * v1.1: http://www.tdda.info/first-test

  * v1.2: http://www.tdda.info/unit-tests (pending)

  * v1.3: http://www.tdda.info/extracting-more-apple-health-data (pending)



Various commits are tagged with version numbers of the form v1.0 etc,
so you can check out a particular version with

    $ git checkout v1.0

etc., provided you pull the tags

    $ git pull --tags

if your copy of git isn't set up to do this by default.

NOTE: this will leave you in a "detached HEAD" state in git.
You can get back to HEAD when you're finished by saying:

    $ git checkout master
